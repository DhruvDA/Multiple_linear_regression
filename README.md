#Multiple_linear_regression
I will learn the generic steps that are required to build a multiple linear regression model. I will build this model for a housing dataset and predict the price of a house using the various potential predictor variables provided. I will first read and visualise your dataset and then prepare your data for building a linear model. This will include dealing with categorical variables, adding dummy variables, and scaling. I will then start building the model with a bottom-up approach, i.e., I will start with one variable and keep on adding more. Once all the variables have been added, I will perform a manual feature elimination and move on to the residual analysis and predictions, as usual. In the end, I will solve the same problem using RFE.
