#Multiple_linear_regression
I will learn the generic steps that are required to build a multiple linear regression model. I will build this model for a housing dataset and predict the price of a house using the various potential predictor variables provided. I will first read and visualise your dataset and then prepare your data for building a linear model. This will include dealing with categorical variables, adding dummy variables, and scaling. I will then start building the model with a bottom-up approach, i.e., I will start with one variable and keep on adding more. Once all the variables have been added, I will perform a manual feature elimination and move on to the residual analysis and predictions, as usual. In the end, I will solve the same problem using RFE.

Problem Statement:

Consider that a real estate company has the data of real estate prices in Delhi. The company wants to optimise the selling price of the properties, based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

Essentially, the company wants:

To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g., area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables, such as the number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well do these variables predict the house prices.
